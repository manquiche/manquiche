# Not a quiche lorraine

I'm a young engineer passionnate about cloud technologies in general. Quite polyvalent, I try to solve problems requiring a large skillset.
Graduated at ENSICAEN in computer science with e-Payments additionnal courses, I'm currently working for Flexcity, which aims to make every company an energy company by enabling [energy flexcibility](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/research-and-technology/flexibility-markets_en).

I am a novice in the open-source community but want to start contributing to projects I believe will help improve our already beautiful cloud computing landscape.

Feel free to contact me ! Also available on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018ec62283e3c44477).

## Technologies
In my day to day life, I mostly work on these following concepts :
* Container orchestration
* GitOps
* Infrastruce as Code
* Big clouds
* Mostly backend development

And more precisely :
* Golang
* Kubernetes
* Pulumi / Terraform
* Linux
* Gitlab CI
* ArgoCD
* And other tools but let's not make it too boring

In my carreer, I had the opportinuty to work on these original subjects :
* PCI-DSS / MPoC certification
* Development of a solution in a FinTech
* ...

## Projects 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on : something secret.

:beers: My last project was about organizing parties with the help of microservices, for no real reason but to learn how to work with them (at this time I was a complete beginner). This project is called Ricardo and you will find some related projects below.
